# Data Validation Types

Data validation ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and meaningful before processing or storage. The most common types of data validation include:

1.  **Type Validation**

    *   Ensures that data is of the correct type (e.g., integer, string, boolean).
    *   Example: A field requiring an integer should not accept a floating-point number or text.

2.  **Range and Constraint Validation**

    *   Ensures that values fall within a predefined range or meet logical constraints.
    *   Example: Human height should be between 0 cm and 300 cm, as historical data indicates that no human has exceeded this height.

3.  **Code and Cross-Reference Validation**

    *   Confirms that a given value belongs to a predefined set of acceptable values.
    *   Example: A product category must be one of \[Electronics, Apparel, Home & Kitchen].

4.  **Structured Validation**

    *   Applies more complex rules to ensure data integrity and proper formatting.
    *   Example: Ensuring an email follows the format name@example.com.

5.  **Consistency Validation**

    *   Ensures that relationships between data points are logically valid.
    *   Example: The sales date must always be before the shipping date.

By implementing these validation types, organizations can maintain high-quality data and minimize errors in data processing.
